# Terraform-Azure-Infra

ðŸš€ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project to deploy and manage Azure resources using Terraform.

## ðŸ§± What I Built

- Deployed a scalable 2048 Game setup on Azure using:
  - Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
  - Load Balancer
  - Network Interface, NSG, VNet/Subnet
  - Public IP and NICs

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Terraform
- Azure CLI
- VS Code
- GitHub for version control

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project

I built this to get hands-on with real-world Infrastructure as Code in Azure. It helps me understand how scalable and modular deployments can be automated using Terraform modules.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots

*(Coming soon â€” will upload screenshots of Azure Portal + Terraform output)*
